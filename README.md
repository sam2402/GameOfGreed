# Game of Greed

## Rules

 Greed is a dice game played between two or more players. The object of the game is to tally points from the dice rolls and be the first player to score 5,000 points. There are five dice in the game that are rolled from a cup.

To enter the game, a player must score at least 300 points on the first roll of his or her turn; otherwise, the player is considered “bust”. If the player goes bust, he or she must wait their turn to roll again.

If this first roll produces 300 or more points, then the player has the option of stopping and keeping the initial score or continuing. To continue, the player rolls only the dice that have not yet scored in this turn.

A player may continue rolling until all the dice have scored or until they go bust. With the exception of the entry roll, a bust is when an individual roll produces no points. The player may stop and keep their score after any roll as long as they have not gone bust.

If all the dice score on a single role, then the player can continue and roll all the dice again. When a player goes bust or opts to stop, the dice are passed to the next player for their turn. Each player keeps the running total of all the scores from their turns.  
The score for each dice roll is determined as follows:

 - Three of a kind (three dice all showing the same value) scores 100 times the face value (e.g, if three dice are showing 3, then 100 x 3). 
	 - But if the face value is one, then it is scored as 1,000 (e.g. there are three dice showing 1).  
 - Single dice showing 1 or 5, score100 and 50 points respectively.

Finally, the winner is determined after a player collects a total score of 5,000 or more and all players have had an equal number of turns. If, for example, a player scores over 5,000 points, they may still lose if a subsequent player ends up with a greater final score.
